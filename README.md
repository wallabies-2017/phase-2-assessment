Event Management Application
============================

**Disclaimer**: *This Readme may change several times before 10 am*

Using Django Rest Framework and Vue.js create an application that accomplishes the following...

You will be building an event management application. Your program will contain at least users and events. Users can attend many events and an event can be attended by many users. Events are created by the user and thus belongs to the user. A user can create multiple events.

The requirements for are in the form of [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Plan what is needed to provide the experience for each User Story and execute it. Execute each user story sequentially from top to bottom.


### User Stories:
* As a user, I can register for an account and sign in/out. (i.e. an account has a unique e-mail, password)
* As a user, I can create new events (Events have a title, description, location).
* As a user, I can edit events I have created.
* As a user, I can destroy events I have created.
* As a user, I can view a list of all events.
* As a user, I can sign up to **attend** an event.
* As a user, I have a personal page that shows all the events that I've **created** and **attended**
* As a user, I would like a clean and approachable interface.
